One needs to be wary about the potential size of this record and force TC to avoid amplification. This could be prevented by using a URI mechanism (via specially formatted TXT or actually leveraging a [URI RR type (RFC7553)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7553)?\r\n\r\nThat URI could lead to a [IP Geolocation feed (RFC8805)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8805).\r\n\r\nIf TXT, it could probably take the form of \"rfc8805:https://example.com/feed ips:2001:db8::/32|iata ips:198.51.100.0/24|iata\"....\r\n\r\nCapturing this here as it would make a natural contender: [Lists of Address Prefixes (APL RR)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3123), but this would limit to IP ranges only.",
